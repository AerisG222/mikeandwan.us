there are a few things you need to do in order to be able to use gmail for smtp...

ref: http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Security

1) create new gmail user / pass
2) login with this and accept license (this is only to be used for the site)
3) configure forward for this address to a preferred email / distribution list
4) gmail requires SSL/TLS, so you need to load certificates (as root):
   > mozroots --import --ask-remove --machine
   > certmgr -ssl -m smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465

   - note: you will need to accept the warning about invalid certs in #4
   - note: although the site uses ssl and gmail port 587, use the url above

5) make sure your code properly specifies the gmail stuff, along with this account's
   proper username / password.

6) you need to enable 'less secure apps' on the gmail account (or improve security using the following):
