    This originally was a small tool that hopefully would help me learn Silverlight, and letters and numbers for my
    daughter.  However, this was only partially successful - my daughter mastered her part, but I am still clueless
    with Silverlight, but that is ok, as it is effectively dead.  Instead, this is now an attempt for me to learn
    angular js, before a re-write of the more complicated picture application.
