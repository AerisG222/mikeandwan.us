#mikeandwan.us
mikeandwan.us is my personal website.  This has taken many forms over the years, which 
first appeared at this domain in 2003.  This site serves a number of purposes:

  - Share photos and videos with my family and friends
  - Provide some tools that I occasionally find useful
  - Allows me to play with different technologies

## Current Status
Over the past year or two, I have been porting my MVC5 site to .Net Core.  A first release
of this is now available on my site, and is being served with beta7 of the new ASP.NET stack.
Since that release, I have undertaken a lot of additional changes that are still in process:

  - Keep updating with latest ASP.Net Core bits (now on RC2)
  - Porting angularjs apps to anglar 2 (much of this is still in flux)
  - Decided to migrate from mysql to postgres (been thinking of this for a while, and had better EFCore support than mysql)
  - Working on updating tools used to feed the site - in particular reworking the photo
    resize tool to try and improve the generated files for the website

My hope is shortly after .Net RTM and Angular 2 RTM, this codebase will be in good shape,
and a new version of the site will be published.  I intend to keep this site current as
things are updated, but am looking forward to a little break once this release is shipped ;).

## Motivation

I hope that this code will offer someone either a starting point for their own site. 
However, I suspect this might serve a better example of what not to do =D.  If you find
this useful, or run across ideas for improvement, I would appreciate hearing from you via
the Issues section of github - thanks!
